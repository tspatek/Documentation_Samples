## Doc Samples

### Writing Process

I wrote each document from scratch, including the code samples. No other technical writer or editor altered them. I wrote and published each document over a two month period, broken up into two-week sprints. At the same time, I also completed other user stories. 

I obtained the new feature information from:

* Confluence design documents

* Development, QA, and Product Management interviews

* Developer source code

* Multiple unit tests of the API on my cloud account

* Multiple tests of the UI on my cloud account

### Style Guides

The documents conformed to a Developer Documentation Style Guide I created for my team. They also conformed to a Documentation Department Style Guide, based on the Microsoft Manuel of Style.
